This project was undertaken during the course Data Science (4032DASC6), taught by Dr. Niki Van Stein (https://www.nikivanstein.nl/) at Leiden University during the academic year 2023 - 2024. Link to the studyguide: https://studiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/courses/111415/data-science. The dataset and assignment specification used was provided by Dr. Van Stein and is uploaded here for reproducibility purposes. 

The Notebook.ipynb produces the HTML file which is viewable on https://elena-petridou.github.io, and can be interpreted using the Report.pdf.

The project was completed with fellow student Andrew Spiro. 

To run the notebook: ensure that the raw datasets as well as the country info data is in the same directory.
